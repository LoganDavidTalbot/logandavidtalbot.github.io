	<p>
		As part of this project, Logan has been given the responsibility to design, build and deploy a RESTful Web service to provide access to system functionality,
		 for an existing legacy code base for a secure thrid party development. He needed to work directly with the client to ensure that the end product meets the client’s needs. 
		 The client is confident enough in his technical ability that he was utilised as the “technical expert” to explain the technologies and concepts to them to allow them 
		 to come to an informed decision on various aspects of the requirements. In particular, what security and authentication method is needed for the RESTful web service (OAuth 2).
		  The RESTful web service successfully delivered to the client within the client's specified timescale and specification. 
		  Logan was also required to maintain the existing legacy code base and provide enhancements at the client's request.
		  Again, Logan was involved in the full software development lifecycle.
