	<p>
		Logan has developed single-page applications that interacted with UKâ€™s Railway infrastructure. This provided real-time information direct to Train Control Rooms throughout 
		the UK with multiple Train Companies as clients. He worked on the Client Side and the underlining services that powered it, 
		requiring him to interact with a large code base. The software used was JavaScript and ASP.net for the website with services that utilised WCF. 
		The Darwin project is still one of the most challenging projects Logan has had the pleasure to be part off. This was due to the project being nine months late 
		and the condition of the software when he joined the project. To combat these issues, Logan was part of a small development team for a six-month period to get the 
		website to production ready standard. 
		By the end of the project, it was accepted by all three clients, showing an excellent drive to complete the project and to achieve good results under pressure.
